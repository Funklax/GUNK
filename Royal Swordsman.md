#Person #Conflict 

The first of the two [[Royal Guards]] of [[Von Windstelt]]
Notable traits include:
* Very strong attacks
* Only attacks every other turn, after he takes a stance:
	* Balanced: Will block any hit received and riposte on the attacker
	* High: Will slam down on target within 5 feet, dealing 5 foot AOE of half force damage
	* Low: Will thrust towards target 10 to 15 feet away with a strong pierce
	* Wide: Will grab target within 5 feet and deal massive bludgeoning damage
* Has a pair of wings that follow his arms movements, that are attached to his back
Weaknesses:
* When he adopts a low or balanced stance, if a perception check has been made on his back, then a spot between the wings is found that is weak to all damage.
