#Place 
Small town located in [[Zaradura]]'s [[Loathsome Wastelands]]

This town was once located in the only oasis in the loathsome wastelands, and was the original location intended for [[Albert Flannigan]]'s ritual. However, after arriving at the town and realizing his calculations were wrong, had already destroyed the town with a powerful [[Ritual]]. Not a strong enough ritual for a [[ritual of separation]], but it did strengthen his power somewhat. However, since the ritual was incomplete, powerful necromantic magic was cast over the town, turning all of the residents into [[Zombie]]s.
