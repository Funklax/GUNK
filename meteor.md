The meteor that, millennia ago at the [[The Great Shatter]], crashed into the world and created the [[grand deep]]. The meteor itself is still preserved on [[Secret Island]], and is the location for the [[ritual of separation]] [[Albert Flannigan]] wishes to carry out. It is located in the basement of the [[Albert Flannigan's Tower]], and the place that the ritual begins at.

The meteor itself contains residual magical energy that can be harnessed in specific rituals in order to increase their potency.
