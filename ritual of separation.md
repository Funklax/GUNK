#Ritual #Conflict 

A [[ritual]] that, when successfully completed, separates a warlock from his patron through forceful breaking of the [[contract]].

The ritual that [[Albert Flannigan]] intends to carry out is a modification of his own design, that will steal the powers of [[Patron]] and make [[Albert Flannigan]] his own power source.
