#Team #Conflict 
The hearthians are 1 of the original 2 main families of [[Pottsfield]].
They are the main inhabitants and controllers, and drive the main conflict of pottsfield.

During the [[Civil War of Pottsfield]], they eradicated all of the [[Opulents]] except for one, [[Brendham Opulent]].

They now wish to carry out the [[Hearthian Plot]], and kill all magic users, starting with [[Side Place 2]].
