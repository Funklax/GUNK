| The party has been told they were brought back to life by [[BBEG]], and as payment, are to do as he says to help him.                                                          | They have actually been kidnapped, and have had their memories altered by [[BBEG]]'s magic                                                                                                    |
| [[BBEG]] requests that the party help him to perform tasks in 5 cities, in order for a [[ritual of ascension]] to be performed, enlightening [[BBEG]] to the status of demigod | The ritual is actually a powerful [[ritual of separation]], used to separate [[BBEG]] from [[Patron]]. This is intended to steal the power of [[Patron]] and make [[BBEG]] a pseudo-sorcerer. |
| [[BBEG]] tells the party that he will share his newfound powers with them, and make them his [[angel]]s.                                                                       | [[BBEG]] plans to sacrifice the party as part of the ritual, sapping their powers in order to combat [[Patron]]'s powers                                                                      |
